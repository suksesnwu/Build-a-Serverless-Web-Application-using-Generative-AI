# Build-a-Serverless-Web-Application-using-Generative-AI
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless web application using AWS Amplify, Amazon Bedrock, and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model. Users can input a list of ingredients, and the application generates recipes based on the input. The app features an HTML-based user interface and a backend to handle AI-generated recipe requests.
