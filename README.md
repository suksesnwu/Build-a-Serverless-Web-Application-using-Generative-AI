# Build-a-Serverless-Web-Application-using-Generative-AI
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless web application using AWS Amplify, Amazon Bedrock, and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model. Users can input a list of ingredients, and the application generates recipes based on the input. The app features an HTML-based user interface and a backend to handle AI-generated recipe requests.

## Application Architecture
This application uses AWS Amplify, a GraphQL API built with AWS AppSync, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock.

## Tasks Covered:
1. Host a Static Website: Configure AWS Amplify to host the frontend application with continuous deployment.
2. Manage Users: Set up Amplify Auth to enable access to the Amazon Bedrock foundation model.
3. Build a Serverless Backend: Develop a serverless backend to handle web app requests.
4. Call the API from the Static Website: Use Amplify Data to connect the frontend with the backend.
5. Build the Frontend: Link the appâ€™s frontend with the backend.
